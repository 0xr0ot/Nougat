Basicc Block Simplifier Test Design Document (FOR N VERSION)

Tests for BB_simplifier optimization should cover basic cases when empty If-Else cab appear.
Post-processing script (checking that optimization is (or is not) applied) relies on output printed when "-Xcompiler-option -j1 -Xcompiler-option --print-passes=bb_simplifier" option is specified

The following cases are covered:

- Standard set of tests
    * Simple If Else cases
    * Nested Ifs cases
    * Nested If Elses cases
    * Sequence of Ifs
    * Sequence of If Elses
    * Sequences of IFs in different loops
    * Sequence of IFs in nested loops

- Standard set of tests in BEFORE TRY/CATCH block
- Standard set of tests in TRY block
- Standard set of tests in CATCH block
- Standard set of tests in FINALLY block
- Standard set of tests in AFTER TRY/CATCH block
